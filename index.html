            <h2>What is Taverns of Tiefenthal?</h2>
            <p>
                Taverns of Tiefenthal is a boardgame about running a tavern, hiring staff, serving customers, and upgrading your establishment. 
                The game uses dice drafting and dice placement as its main mechanics but also contains deckbuilding and with the expansion "Open Doors" it also features more distinct asymetrical player powers.
                The game was designed by Wolfgang Warsch, a Austrian game designer and molecular biologist, in 2019 with the expansion seeing an english release in 2021.

                <h3> Why have a fan page for this game?</h3>          
                <p>
                    Taverns of Tiefenthal is a fairly well known boardgame. 
                    However it is not as critically acclaimed as Wolfgangs poster child Quacks of Quedlinburg. 
                    Nor has it gotten the same cult following as The Mind and unlike Wavelength, 
                    who boasts a common description of "the gameshow in a box", 
                    the buzz for Taverns has somewhat died down since its release, 
                    Seeing only a brief spike of interest with the english release of the expansion Open Doors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a great shame as Taverns boasts an atmosphere unlike any of the other names mentioned. 
                    It is evocative of the crackling of a fireplace with enough required brainpower to keep one engaged without becoming overwhelming. 
                    Taverns also benefits from a level of modularity in which each modual builts on the last to add thematic and mechanical depth to the game. 
                    Without any optional moduals the optimal strategy quickly devolves into prioitizing money in order to gain upgrades which lures nobles, whom are great for scoring. 
                    This harms the themeing of serving patrons, making merry, serving beer. 
                    However with the reputation modual players gains benefits each round depending on what they produce less of 
                    - beer or money. Meaning that players are incentivized to balance their production and suddenly the theme is stronger than ever. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Taverns of Tiefenthal is also severly underrated as a couples game. 
                    With 4 players there can be quite a lot of downtime, despite the games best attempts at simultanous phases when playerorder doesn't matter.
                    But with 2 players downtime is very minimal and you can also reasonably pay attention to the other players actions. 
                    The cozy theme also servers nicely for a game with minimal player conflict, with the dice drafting and customer row being the two possible points of friction.
                    This may also only be a personal preference but since the number of dice drafted don't change with player counts the drafting process is more interesting at a lower player count - 
                    With more players you get fewer chances of a coaster coming back to you and thus a core aspect of drafting falls to the wayside - 
                    as less plans can be made about what you can send away without risking another player taking what you want.

                <h3> What about Open Doors?</h3>          
                <p>
                    Open Doors is the first and currently only expansion to Taverns of Tiefenthal and while the base game is quite enjoyable, 
                    after <i>a few plays</i>, Open Doors does breathes some very welcome fresh air into the game.
                </p>
                <!-- Safer option for reducing dependencies to external sources would be to keep a copy of the image with the html files and reference that as source -->

                <p>
                    Open doors is a modular expansion and allows mixing and matches the aspects of the game you like the most, personally after a learning period
                    I am using all modulas from both the base game and the expansion for every play. This brings playtime for us at 2 players to about 2 hours without 
                    setup and teardown.
                </p>                
                <p>
                    Out of the four moduals the one that adds the most variety to the game is adding variable player powers, in terms of the bartenders. 
                    While the base game does have some minor variable player loadouts with the 4th modual, these very very tame in contrast to the bartenders, whom for example will let you: 
                    Upgrade cheaper, use 3s and 4s as wild dice, an upgraded guestbook, an upgraded reputation track, or a new minor bonus each round that can be redeemed now or later.
                    Couple this with another modual with varaible quests and rewards and stagnant strategies can no longer be relied upon. And most importantly I can finally be competitive by 
                    trying to lap the other players on the monastery track.
